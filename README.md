Dear examiner,

Welcome to Muhammad Azizi Fahmi's portfolio.

This is Simple Web API which is to manage Freelance Developer for CDN.

As to implement this one, I implement using Dependency Injection to inject the data.
For short, dependency injection in we inject the class into another class to be used. 
More efficiency compare to conventional object creation.

Flow for this Web API is as below :
Request will be landing on Controller. From Controller it will fetch and sned to Service. Service will use Model to manage data before send abck to Entity to communicate with Database.

As for this, I'm using MariaDB for the database platform and for the backend processing using .NET 6

Code and DB can be access in this repository.

The program can be access in Heroku through this link : https://tb-muhammad-9b1e6cc4ab80.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html

Hopefully my writing can tackle examiner/hiring manager to be selected for next stage.
